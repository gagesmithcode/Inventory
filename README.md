# Forked repository of ChicoState/Inventory under gagesmithcode

Getting Started:

Hello! In order to get started with this application, make sure you have cloned an up to date version of this repository. Once that is done, navigate to the repository within your command line interface. From there building the application is as easy as typing "make" and pressing enter. You will notice upon the finishing of make you will have a new file in your directory that says "a.out". To run the application simply run that file by typing "./a.out".
